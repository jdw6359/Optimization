Speed Analysis:

Iterations=1000

C Program:
The line is: Y = 1.265397 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 3.45 msec.

C++ Program:
The line is: Y = 1.2654 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 8.92 msec.


Iterations=2500

C Program:
The line is: Y = 1.265397 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 3.37 msec.

C++ Program:
The line is: Y = 1.2654 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 9.124 msec.


Iterations=5000

C Program:
The line is: Y = 1.265397 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 3.43 msec.

C++ Program:
The line is: Y = 1.2654 * X + 0.339927
Time Per Calulation: (DataTimer) = 9.172 msec.


After running both programs for 1000, 2500, and 5000 iterations, it is 
clear that the c program has a massive performance advantage over
its c++ counterpart. In all scenarios, the c program takes between 3.37 
and 3.45 ms to complete each iteration. In the case of the c++ program, 
8.92 and 9.172 ms are the bounds for each iteration. 

Size Analysis:

Static Memory Use:


C Program:

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
 793646	   6128	  11240	 811014	  c6006	hw2_c


C++ Program:

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
1309951	  10680	  94448	1415079	 1597a7	hw2_cpp

After running the size executable on both the c and c++ programs, 
it is clear that the c++ program has more of a cumbersome
impact on the computers resources. 

The text values of 1309951 and 793646 show that the c++ code (when 
executed) contains almost double the machine code to be executed. 

The data values of 10680 and 6128 show that the c++ program initializes
and sets almost double the amount of memory as opposed to its c 
counterpart.


The bss values of 94448 and 11240 represent the amount of memory that each
program itializes to a zero value. On top of the data value described above, 
the c+ program needs to allocate almost 10x the memery of the c program. 
The main reason for this is most likely the fact that the c++ program
uses the list data structure where as the c program utilizes the dynamic 
array, which does not require nearly as much memory to be initially 
allocated.
